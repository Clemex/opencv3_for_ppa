opencv3 (3.0.0-0ubuntu1ppa3~trusty1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Added new imgcodecs library.
  * Commited to rather painful renaming of all sub-packages to libopencv3-*
    and removing the version number (was "2.4" then "3.0") in the package name
    itself. e.g. libopencv-core3.0.

opencv3 (3.0.0-0ubuntu1ppa2~trusty1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Unable to resolve how the ippicv_linux_*.tar.gz download fits into this.
    For now have included it as a binary in the diff.
